<p>
Please watch the first 8 minutes of the video below (before the C++ code part) to review the binary search algorithm for efficiently searching pre-sorted arrays.  Be prepared to discuss the time complexity of this algorithm on Monday (I will call on someone randomly for their thoughts).  We will work in groups to implement this in class on Monday.
